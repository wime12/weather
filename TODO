* Write a Makefile

* Write a manpage

* Maybe: Make "weather" accept a database file, e.g. "~/.weather-places"
  of place names and WOEIDs into the configuration
  file so that weather can be called with a place name.

* Maybe: Write a utility to populate this database.
  This utility should also list the entries in the database and
  check for illegal entries. Line beginning with # are comments.
